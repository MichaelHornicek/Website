##Final Project:
#The aim is to build a website, that allows a manager to monitor the operations and working hours of
the users on the projects.
The home page starts with general information (this includes who developed it, which year, etc).
There is login page that allows login/signup. There are two types users in the system:
Manager/Employee. The Manager is unique (can you extend it to have multiple Manager?) For the
initial setup the Manager username is “admin” and the password is “1234”. The employees can be
any number, with any password. There are also projects in the system. Let’s say there are three
projects A, B, C. Each employee is assigned to one project.
#Manager role:
The Manager has full control over the system. i.e., it can see all the employees, and their working
hours. In addition, the manager is the only one that can add or remove new projects to the existing list
of “projects”. The manager can get a report of how many hours so far has put into each project. (can
you extend it so that the manager gets a report of how many hours each employee has worked?) Of
course there should be a logout button for the Manager. So, to summarize, the manager should see all
the employees, and how much hour is put into each project, and be able to add or remove projects.
#Employee role:
Each employee after loging in has only access to his/her own information. In addition an employee can
update their own information (the information include phone number, address, first/last name, date
of birth). Finally, an employee can register their working hours to the project that they are assigned
to. Of course there should be a logout button for the employee.
